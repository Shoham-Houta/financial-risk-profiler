| Column                   | Strategy            |

| Years at Current Job     | Impute with median |
| DTI Ratio                | Impute as Loan Amount / Income |
| Categorical columns      | Impute with mode or "Unknown" |

## âœ… 3. Derived Features

### ðŸ”¹ Debt & Expense Estimation
- `Annual_Debt` = `DTI` Ã— `Income`
- `Estimated_Expenses` = `Income Ã— 0.80 Ã— (1 + 0.10 Ã— Number of Dependents)`
- `Estimated_Savings` = `Income âˆ’ Estimated_Expenses`
- `Non_Debt_Expenses` = `Estimated_Expenses âˆ’ Annual_Debt`
- `Savings_Ratio` = `Estimated_Savings / Income`
- `Implied_Debt_From_Spending` = `max(0, Estimated_Expenses âˆ’ Income)`

### ðŸ”¹ Loan-Related Calculations
- `Loan_to_Income_Ratio` = `Loan Amount / Income`
- `Loan Purpose` â†’ encoded as categorical risk
- `Credit Score` â†’ binned into buckets
- (Optional) `Estimated_Monthly_Payment` via annuity formula

---

## âœ… 4. Feature Engineering & Normalization
- One-hot encode: Gender, Education Level, Marital Status, Loan Purpose, Employment Status, Payment History
- Ordinal/binning: Credit Score, Years at Current Job (optional)
- Normalize: Income, Loan Amount, Annual Debt, Savings Ratio, etc.

---

## âœ… 5. Optional Risk Indicators
- `Total_Burden` = `Annual_Debt + Implied_Debt_From_Spending`
- `At_Risk` flags:
  - Savings Ratio < 0.05
  - Loan-to-Income Ratio > 0.5
  - Credit Score < 600
  - Dependents > 2 with low income
